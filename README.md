# algo-practice
A collection of programming exercises, projects, and experiments in multiple languages.

## MIPS
These programs are written in MIPS assembly language, developed and tested using the MARS simulator (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator). Each program demonstrates low-level control and computational logic, useful for understanding computer architecture and machine-level programming.

Contents:
1) prime_factorization.asm: Reads an integer n from input and prints its prime factors in order (e.g., for n = 60, output is 2 2 3 5).
2) diagonally_dominant_matrix.asm: The program checks if a 3x3 matrix is diagonally dominant.
