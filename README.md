# algo-practice
A collection of programming exercises, projects, and experiments in multiple languages.

## MIPS
These programs are written in MIPS assembly language, developed and tested using the MARS simulator (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator). Each program demonstrates low-level control and computational logic, useful for understanding computer architecture and machine-level programming.

Contents:
1) prime_factorization.asm: Reads an integer n from input and prints its prime factors in order (e.g., for n = 60, output is 2 2 3 5).
2) diagonally_dominant_matrix.asm: The program checks if a 3x3 matrix is diagonally dominant.
3) recursive_example.asm: demonstrates recursive function calls and stack usage in MIPS by computing a nested product with changing arguments.

## Python 
### Sorting Algorithms and Data Structures
This section contains a single Python file, sorting.py, dedicated to implementing and analyzing fundamental algorithms and data structures covered in introductory computer science and algorithms courses. The code provides clear implementations and includes performance testing.sorting.py. Algorithms included: 
1) Insertion Sort
2) Selection Sort
3) Merge Sort
4) Heap Sort
5) Quick Sort
6) Counting Sort
7) Performance Analysis: Built-in test sections for Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort that measure execution time across various array sizes.
